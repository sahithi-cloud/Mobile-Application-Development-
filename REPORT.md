- [X] Verbose output (via the `-v` flag) is implemented
- [X] I used the provided starter code
- The simulator runs correctly (to the best of my knowledge) on the provided configuration file(s):
  - [X] conf/sim1.yaml
  - [X] conf/sim2.yaml

## Summary and Reflection

I used the given starter files from the repo provided, implemented processes in the simulation.dart file using data structures like lists, maps. 

Through this assignment I could understand the basics of dart and implementation of functions, class and methods in Dart Language. Although as a beginner, I faced some trouble in handling exceptions and trying to get the right outputs for stochastic processes. 

After this assignment, I can understand the difference and computation process of singleton, periodic stochastic process.
